# Statistics Lab Notes for MATH 2820L

This is the set of notes I used in teaching the statistics lab at Vanderbilt University in Fall '16 and Spring '17. The class met for 1-hour a week for a total of 12 weeks, hence the notes are not intended to cover every detail in R programming. Instead, I focused on the most widely used tools in current R community (highly opinionated) that will help new R users without prior programming experience start their data analysis projects. The notes are produced with R markdown and output as .html files. 

* Lab 1: Visualization with ggplot2
* Lab 2: Basic commands/data types in R
* Lab 3: Data transformation with dplyr
* Lab 4: Simple examples of exploratory analysis
* Lab 5-6: Linear regression
* Lab 7-8: Classification with logistic regression and KNN
* Lab 9-11: Model assessment
